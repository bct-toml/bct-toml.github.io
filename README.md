Blackchiptoken is a decentralised utility token, birthed by fervent pioneers and contributors to foster global mass adoption and daily usage of cryptocurrency across the continent of Africa through incentives and a global peer-to-peer marketplace. Built on Stellar Network to maintain 0% trading fees, low cost gasfee and super fast transactions, with max total supply of 21 billion, ownership renounced and Liquidity locked forever.

### What is the purpose?
