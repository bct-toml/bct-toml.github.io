### What is Blackchip token?
Blackchip token is a decentralised utility token, birthed by fervent pioneers and contributors to foster mass adoption and daily usage of cryptocurrency across the continent of Africa through incentives and a global online peer-to-peer marketplace. Built on Stellar Network to maintain 0.3% slippage fee, low cost gasfee and super fast transactions, with max total supply of 21 billion, ownership renounced and Liquidity locked forever.
### What is the purpose?
The goal is to solve the problem of very limited virtual currency usage in the real world by fostering mass adoption and daily usage of cryptocurrency through fair distribution of incentives and provision of a global online peer-to-peer marketplace, where users can buy and sell products/services, using blackchiptoken (cryptocurrency) for transactions. Ideally this will help to suppress the effect of local monetary policies that are limiting cross-border transactions and entrepreneurial services in African countries.

### Frequently Asked Questions
#### Why the Stellar Blockchain Network?
Blackchiptoken pioneers choose to build on the Stellar Network because it is the best blockchain network that suit the purpose, which will enable the continuous development of Blackchiptoken without limitations. And most importantly Stellar supports global peer-to-peer onchain spot trading through its decentralised exchange directly on Stellar wallets for free. With Stellar you are fully in control; it is simply "your keys, your crypto and funds".
#### What is the Use Case for Blackchiptoken?
Blackchiptoken is a decentralised and community-driven crypto project. Regardless, we believe the use case development and success lies in the strength of its growing community that believes in the social of shared value. This is what has taken the likes of Doge and Shiba Inu meme tokens to billions of dollars in the market value without actual utility.

Blackchiptoken ownership has been renounced. Therefore it is collectively owned by the pioneers, contributors and the global community. There is no CEO, no VC or board members pulling the strings in the background.
